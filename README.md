# NLP Chatbot Expressed as an Endpoint API
This chatbot is powered by a logsitic regression model trained with natural language processing and machine learning techniques. The underlying framework for the project is Flask as a package rather than as a module. The package structure provides better support for containerization with Docker. Some packges do not work well with projects based around modules. Here wsgi.py acts as an entry point for its namesake, the Web Server Gateway Interface server, which enables the server to interact with the Flask application. Unless you are running nginx with a configuration file locally, please use run.py when testing the application. Unit tests are not particularly optmized for the dataset. While the tests run, two out of three fail. Please move the tests out of the tests folder, and into the same directory as run.py in order to run them with these commands: pytest -v or pytest -v tests/.
